# Welcome to the Kiota abstractions section

The Kiota abstractions are language specific libraries defining the basic constructs Kiota projects need once an SDK has been generated from an OpenAPI definition.
Your project will need a reference to the abstraction package to build and run, the following languages are currently supported:

- [Dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-abstractions-dotnet)
- [Java](./java)
- [Go](./go)
- [Ruby](./ruby/microsoft_kiota_abstractions)
- [TypeScript](./typescript)
- [PHP](./php)
- [Python](./python)
